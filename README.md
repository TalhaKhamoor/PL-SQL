# PL-SQL
This project is based on the We Keep It Storage (WKIS) Companyâ€™s system, an accounting system. Transactions (this is a double-entry accounting system) will be taken from a holding table (NEW_TRANSACTIONS) and inserted into the TRANSACTION_DETAIL and TRANSACTION_HISTORY tables. At the same time, the appropriate account balance will be updated in the ACCOUNT table. This system follows a double entry accounting system with the accounting rules presented in class.
